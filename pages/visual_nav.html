            At Northeastern University, I had taken Robotics Sensing and Navigation which contained a final project at the end. For this
            final project, I developed a visual navigation system along with teammates. My main contribution to this project
            was acquiring the data for the experiment, writing the computer vision algorithms for horizon identification
            and writing the horizon matching algorithm. For the data acquisition this was done in a Lincoln MKZ with a Point
            Grey camera aimed out the window on Tremont Street. GPS+IMU data used as reference was sampled and broadcasted
            over ROS and the camera data was acquired with the GPS time base. As for the computer vision algorithms, I used
            MATLAB for the analysis and was able to profile the code to run in near real-time by determining the optimal
            camera resolution for localization.
