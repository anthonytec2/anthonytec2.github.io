                                to develop the theoretical/experimental framework for obtaining video frame rate millimeter wave images. My role in this project has ranged from implementation of low level hardware controls for the array all the way up
                                to designing algorithms for image reconstruction.

                                The visual navigation project was my final project in Robotics Sensing and Navigation that applied computer vision to localize a robot in urban outdoor settings. This algorithm worked by placing a visible wavelength camera with a view of the horizon of
                                the enviorment and using the horizon line as a unique identifier for the location. Another part of this project was testing the use of an IR camera to evaluate its performance on localization using the same algorithm as
                                the above.

                                My Solar Flare Detection project was a project using the Stanford Solar Science center’s Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance(SID) instrument to detect solar flares in real time. For this instrument, I designed a custom loop antenna to hook up to which was
                                then amplified by the SID instrument and digitized by a computer sound card. The principle behind this system is it measured very low frequency signal(VLF) propagation over time. Since, flares cause the ionosphere to become
                                more reflective VLF signal strength increases. Hence, I designed an end to end system to detect this increase and notify when flares occur. This project resulted in me being a finalist at the International Science and Engineering
                                Fair, the Junior Humanities Symposium and publishing an article on these results in the United Nations Space Weather Journal.

                                At CERN, I was a University of Michigan fellow working under Dr. Tancredi Carli (CERN ATLAS Director of Physics) on the tile calorimeter project. My work on the tile calorimeter involved increasing the image resolution of the current detector by replacing
                                the current single sensor readout with a multi sensor readout. This involved the development of various 3D printed light spreaders to properly map the fiber light sources to the sensor, creation of signal processing algorithms
                                for the multi sensor readout and development of characterization methods for these sensors.

                                One recent article in Popular Science that interested our hackathon team was about a system known as a LIFI(Light Fidelity) network(100x faster than wifi), which allows for full duplex communication. Based on this idea, our team decided it was feasible
                                to develop a small scale prototype of a LIFI network. This is how the idea to develop Pong Over Laser Link came to be. Our team wanted to develop the above network with a fun twist of gaming to test out the characteristics
                                of the LIFI band. Implementing a video game added the challenge of minimizing processing delays and keeping the system as close to real time as possible. </div>

                                come to Northeastern University over the weekend to take classes. My part in this event was I taught classes in Arduino and digital logic design. Another event that I participate in is Friday field trips for high school
                                students to visit Northeastern. The basics behind this event is students come to Northeastern and participate in fun scientific activities. My role in this event is I assist student in the activities and have given demonstrations
